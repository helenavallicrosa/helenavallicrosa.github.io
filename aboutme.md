I'm a researcher in terrestrial ecology interested in understanding the flow of elements through plant, soil, and atmosphere compartments and how these could change under global change scenarios and evaluating their impacts. My approaches are from local to global scale through both field experiments and computational science. R programmer!


Currently, I'm a **postdoc** at the [Plant Ecology Research Lab](https://people.epfl.ch/helena.vallicrosa?lang=en)lab, at **École Polytechnique Fédélale de Lausanne** (EPFL), Switzerland. I am working to solve several questions:

1. What is the interaction between climate and nitrogen deposition in European forests?
2. How do drought and temperature affect the nitrogen cycle in grasslands?
3. How does elemental composition affect plant investment in reproductive tissues?
4. Is there a chemical mechanism behind plant frost resistance?

Previously at [Terrer Lab](https://terrerlab.mit.edu/), in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the **Massachusetts Institute of Technology** (MIT). There, I worked around the question ["How much nitrogen are plants taking from the soil yearly?"](http://terrerlab.mit.edu/how-much-nitrogen-can-plants-absorb-soil-yearly) by synthesizing datasets of field observations and remote-sensing data through machine learning to better understand questions related to C-N interactions. I also taught on the graduate course **1.845: Terrestrial Carbon Cycle and Ecosystem Ecology**, materials on the Teaching tab.

I defended my **Ph.D. in Terrestrial Ecology** in November 2021, under the supervision of Prof. Josep Peñuelas and Prof. Jordi Sardans at the Center for Ecological Research and Forestry Applications (CREAF), **Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona**, Spain. The thesis titled "Global change and forest nutrient stoichiometry. The foliar elemental composition of woody plants and its drivers" can be consulted and downloaded [here](https://ddd.uab.cat/pub/tesis/2021/hdl_10803_674539/hvp1de1.pdf).

Feel free to reach out to talk about research, scientific outreach, or cool activities in Catalan, Spanish, English, or Portuguese.
