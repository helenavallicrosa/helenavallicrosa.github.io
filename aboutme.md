title: About me
---

I'm a terrestrial ecologist researcher interested in linking carbon cycle with plant elemental composition, biogeochemical cycles between atmosphere, soil and vegetation and its response to global change scenario. My approaches are from local scale to global scale through both field experiments and computational science.

I'm a postdoc at the Terrer Lab, in the department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

I defended my PhD in Terrestrial Ecology in November of 2021, under the supervision of Josep Peñuelas and Jordi Sardans at CREAF, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Spain.
