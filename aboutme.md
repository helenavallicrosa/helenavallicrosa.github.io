title: About me
---

<div style="text-align: justify"> I'm a terrestrial ecologist researcher interested in linking carbon cycle with plant elemental composition, biogeochemical cycles between atmosphere, soil and vegetation and its response to global change scenario. My approaches are from local to global scale through both field experiments and computational science. </div>

<div style="text-align: justify"> Currently I'm a postdoc at the [Terrer Lab](https://terrerlab.mit.edu/), in the department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). There I'm synthesizing datasets of field observations and remote-sensing data through machine-learning to better understand questions related with C-N interactions. </div>

<div style="text-align: justify"> I defended my PhD in Terrestrial Ecology on November 2021, under the supervision of Josep Peñuelas and Jordi Sardans at CREAF, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Spain. </div>
