I'm a researcher in **terrestrial ecology** interested in understanding the flow of **elements** [N,P,K...] through plant, soil, and atmosphere compartments, how these could be affected by **global change**, and evaluating their impacts. My approaches are from local to global scale through both **field experiments** and **computational science**. R programmer!

Currently, I'm a **postdoc** at the [Plant Ecology Research Lab](https://people.epfl.ch/helena.vallicrosa?lang=en) lab, at **École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne** (EPFL), Switzerland and I am working on several questions:

1. What is the interaction between climate and nitrogen deposition in European forests? Publication [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004896972407061X) 
2. How do drought and temperature increase affect the nitrogen cycle in grasslands?
3. How does elemental composition affect plant investment in reproductive tissues?
4. Is there a chemical mechanism behind plant temperature resistance?

Previously at [Terrer Lab](https://terrerlab.mit.edu/), in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the **Massachusetts Institute of Technology** (MIT). There, I worked around the question ["How much nitrogen are plants taking from the soil yearly?"](http://terrerlab.mit.edu/how-much-nitrogen-can-plants-absorb-soil-yearly) by synthesizing datasets of field observations and remote-sensing data through machine learning to better understand questions related to C-N interactions. See the [Publication](https://esd.copernicus.org/articles/16/1183/2025/). I also taught on the graduate course **1.845: Terrestrial Carbon Cycle and Ecosystem Ecology**, materials on the Teaching tab.

I defended my **Ph.D. in Terrestrial Ecology** in November 2021, under the supervision of Prof. Josep Peñuelas and Prof. Jordi Sardans at the Center for Ecological Research and Forestry Applications (CREAF), **Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona**, Spain. The thesis titled "Global change and forest nutrient stoichiometry. The foliar elemental composition of woody plants and its drivers" can be consulted and downloaded [here](https://ddd.uab.cat/pub/tesis/2021/hdl_10803_674539/hvp1de1.pdf).

Happy to chat about research, scientific outreach, or cool activities in Catalan, Spanish, English, or Portuguese.
