I'm a terrestrial ecologist researcher interested in linking carbon cycle with plant elemental composition, biogeochemical cycles between atmosphere, soil, and vegetation, and its response to global change scenario. My approaches are from local to global scale through both field experiments and computational science.


Currently, I'm a **postdoc** at the [Terrer Lab](https://terrerlab.mit.edu/), in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the **Massachusetts Institute of Technology** (MIT). There, I'm working around the question ["How much nitrogen are plants taking from the soil yearly?"](http://terrerlab.mit.edu/how-much-nitrogen-can-plants-absorb-soil-yearly) by synthesizing datasets of field observations and remote-sensing data through machine learning to better understand questions related to C-N interactions.


I defended my Ph.D. in Terrestrial Ecology in November 2021, under the supervision of Prof. Josep Peñuelas and Prof. Jordi Sardans at CREAF, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Spain. The thesis titled "Global change and forest nutrient stoichiometry. The foliar elemental composition of woody plants and its drivers" can be consulted and downloaded [here](https://ddd.uab.cat/pub/tesis/2021/hdl_10803_674539/hvp1de1.pdf)

Feel free to reach out to talk about research, scientific outreach, or cool activities in Catalan, Spanish, English, or Portuguese.
