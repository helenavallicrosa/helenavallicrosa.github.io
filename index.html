<p style="text-align: justify"> Terrestrial ecologist interested in plant elemental composition and stoichiometry, biogeochemical cycles, plant-soil interactions, and how those
  interact with the carbon cycle and global change. I have worked in Mediterranean and Tropical ecosystems but I have also worked at regional and global scales by using computational science,
  data synthesis, and artificial intelligence algorithms. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify"> I have an interest in teaching, and I enjoy sharing science with the general public, making it reachable and understandable 
  to different ages and backgrounds. </p>
