  interact with the carbon cycle and global change. I have performed fieldwork in Mediterranean and Tropical ecosystems but I have also worked at regional and global scales by using computational science,
  data synthesis, and artificial intelligence algorithms. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify"> I have experience in teaching, and I enjoy sharing science with the general public, making it reachable and understandable 
  to different ages and backgrounds. If you want to know more you can find my publications, teaching material, and outreach activities in the different tabs.  </p>

<h1> News! </h1>
TWICS released the podcast episode where I broke down my science and story as a scientist. Check it out <a href=https://thatsscience.org/2024/05/19/episode-236-elements-of-a-scientist/>here!</a>
<p style="text-align: justify"> The hot, dry Mediterranean, the depths of the tropics and the computer screen, Dr Helena Vallicrosa works in a range of environments to understand how chemical elements, the building blocks of the earth, cycle through ecosystems. The ‘annoying kid’ who always asked questions, a lack of representation in science meant that Helena didn’t always think a career in science was available to her. Now Helena uses ‘big data’ to find patterns and answer big questions about where plants can live and why in the complex landscape of a changing climate. Listen to hear Helena break-down her research, motivations as a scientist, and a career in science (academia vs industry) into their core elements. </p>

MIT just released my course <strong>"Introduction to R and GIS"</strong>. Available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP602LxEgWcCyo89B2Q-zg8gm">YouTube</a> and on MIT's <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/introduction-to-r-and-gis-fall-2023/">OpenCourseWare</a></p>

<p style="text-align: justify">The goal of these videos is to provide students with <strong>tools and concepts for working with R</strong>, a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. The students will learn the basics of R, how to navigate the R interface and deal with different data formats, how to run and interpret linear models with R, and how to use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in R. These practical sessions were developed as part of the course 1.845 Terrestrial Carbon Cycle and Ecosystem Ecology but will be useful for anyone looking to learn about R and GIS. </p>
