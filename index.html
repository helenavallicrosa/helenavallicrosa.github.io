<p style="text-align: justify"> Terrestrial ecologist interested in plant elemental composition and stoichiometry, biogeochemical cycles and how both
  interact with carbon cycle and global change. My approaches are from local scale to global scale through both field experiments and computational science. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify"> I'm also very much interested in sharing the science we do to the general public, making it reachable and understandable 
  to different ages and backgrounds. Science is a great social tool too, let's use it! </p>
