  interact with the carbon cycle and global change. I have performed fieldwork in Mediterranean and Tropical ecosystems but I have also worked at regional and global scales by using computational science,
  data synthesis, and artificial intelligence algorithms. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify"> I have experience in teaching, and I enjoy sharing science with the general public, making it reachable and understandable 
  to different ages and backgrounds. If you want to know more you can find my publications, teaching material, and outreach activities in the different tabs.  </p>

<h1> News! </h1>
MIT just released my course "Introduction to R and GIS". Available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP602LxEgWcCyo89B2Q-zg8gm">YouTube</a> and on MIT's <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/introduction-to-r-and-gis-fall-2023/">OpenCourseWare</a></p>.

The goal of these videos is to provide students with tools and concepts for working with R, a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. The students will learn the basics of R, how to navigate the R interface and deal with different data formats, how to run and interpret linear models with R, and how to use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in R. These practical sessions were developed as part of the course 1.845 Terrestrial Carbon Cycle and Ecosystem Ecology but will be useful for anyone looking to learn about R and GIS. </p>

The recording of my last seminar is  available! <a href="https://mediaspace.epfl.ch/media/Plant+elemental+ecologyA+understanding+plant+nutrient+flows+in+a+global+change+context./0_wf7bti78/56474">View</a></p>

Abstract: This seminar tackles three main points: </p>
<p style="text-align: justify"> i) Introduction to the concept of elemental ecology, which studies the interactions between organisms (plant-soil-ecosystem) through elemental composition and elements flow. Elemental ecology is a relevant tool to study the impact of changes in chemical cycles (Carbon, Nitrogen, Phosphorusâ€¦) associated with global change on ecosystems.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify"> ii) Presentation of the results of a study in preparation: leaf habits and climate drives tree growth sensitivity to N deposition. This study addresses the ReClean goal of better understanding the impacts of N deposition on vegetation at a continental scale.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"> iii) An experiment set up to better understand the N flow in grasslands, accounting for soil N, the microbial community, belowground biomass, aboveground biomass, and reproductive tissues.</p>
