  interact with the carbon cycle and global change. I have performed fieldwork in Mediterranean and Tropical ecosystems but I have also worked at regional and global scales by using computational science,
  data synthesis, and artificial intelligence algorithms. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify"> I have experience in teaching, and I enjoy sharing science with the general public, making it reachable and understandable 
  to different ages and backgrounds. If you want to know more you can find my publications, teaching material, and outreach activities in the different tabs.  </p>

Abstract: This seminar tackles three main points: </p>
<p style="text-align: justify"> i) Introduction to the concept of elemental ecology, which studies the interactions between organisms (plant-soil-ecosystem) through elemental composition and elements flow. Elemental ecology is a relevant tool to study the impact of changes in chemical cycles (Carbon, Nitrogen, Phosphorusâ€¦) associated with global change on ecosystems.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify"> ii) Presentation of the results of a study in preparation: leaf habits and climate drives tree growth sensitivity to N deposition. This study addresses the ReClean goal of better understanding the impacts of N deposition on vegetation at a continental scale.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"> iii) An experiment set up to better understand the N flow in grasslands, accounting for soil N, the microbial community, belowground biomass, aboveground biomass, and reproductive tissues.</p>
