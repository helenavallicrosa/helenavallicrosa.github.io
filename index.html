<div style="text-align: justify"> Terrestrial ecologist researcher interested in plant elemental composition and stoichiometry, biogeochemical cycles, how both interact with carbon cycle and its response to global change. My approaches are from local scale to global scale through both field experiments and computational science. </div>
