## Databases

#### Growth and foliar elemental composition in French Guyana
Measurements after a 3-year N, P, and N+P addition in French Guyana. Collected in 2019 and originally published in Vallicrosa et al., 2023, Ecology (see Publications). Data in .cvs format, including data from 65 different species.

#### Foliar stoichiometry of woody plants worldwide
This data includes foliar N, P, K % in DW of mature leaves in woody plants worldwide, georeferenced information, and plant species. It gathers data from 230 published articles, [TRY database](http://www.try-db.org/TryWeb/dp.php), [ICP forest database](http://icp-forests.net/page/data-requests), the Tundra Trait Team and the Catalan Forest Inventory (Gracia et al., 2004). Compiled until 2020, ~24000 data points.
