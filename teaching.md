In this section, I will be sharing the teaching materials I have been creating and using during my classes. It can include commented R scripts or slides for presentation.

## EPFL: Applied Ecology
The course will provide the ecological systems' knowledge needed to question applied sustainability solutions. We will critically assess the complexity of current environmental issues, illustrating basic ecological concepts and principles.

The course combines elements of a classic lecture, group presentations, case studies, problem-based learning, and field- and lab-work. Our central aim is to balance participants' respect for complexity with a sense of possibility by providing examples from the vast solution space offered by ecological systems, such as e.g. green infrastructure to manage water. The class will include three excursions where the students will have the opportunity to discuss critical ongoing problems faced by environmental managers.

## MIT OpenCourseWare: Introduction to R and GIS (Hands-on online course)

The goal of these videos is to provide students with tools and concepts to work with R. The students will learn the basics of R, how to navigate R interface and deal with different data formats, how to run and interpret linear models with R and how to use Geographical Information Systems (GIS) in R. These practical sessions were developed as part of the course 1.845 Terrestrial Carbon Cycle and Ecosystem Ecology but will be useful for anyone looking to learn about R and GIS.

## MIT Course 1.845: Terrestrial carbon cycle and ecosystem ecology<br/>

Graduate course led by Prof. Cesar Terrer at the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The course included lectures, paper discussions as well and practical sessions. The course targets graduate students interested in earth systems and environmental sciences, willing to acquire basic skills and knowledge about the terrestrial carbon cycle and global ecosystem ecology.

### Lecture

This [lecture](https://github.com/helenavallicrosa/teaching/blob/main/Lecture_Nutrients.pdf) emphasizes the role of nutrients as a cofactor of the land C sink as well as an important variable in understanding ecosystem functioning.

**CONTENT AND INTENDED LEARNING OUTCOMES**<br/>
1. From molecules to ecosystems<br/>
   -Explain the importance of nutrients in plants and how they affect biological processes<br/>
   -Describe the concept of nutrient limitation and nutrient resorption<br/>
2. Global scale patterns<br/>
   -Describe the biogeochemical cycles of nitrogen and phosphorus<br/>
   -Enumerate N and P cycle differences and how those translate to a global scale<br/>  
3. Biogeochemical disruption in the Anthropocene<br/>
   -Describe how humans are affecting biogeochemical cycles and their implications in natural ecosystems<br/>
   -How N, P, and nutrients in general affect the land C sink<br/>

### Practical sessions

**DESCRIPTION:** Their goal is to provide students with tools and good practices to face data analysis applied to earth sciences. The students will practice those skills by using the provided data and following the process of data curation, data analysis, and interpretation. The students are going to learn the basics of R programming, the highlights of C cycle modeling and modeling in ecology, how to work with maps and geographical information systems, the basics and how to use data synthesis techniques such as metanalysis, and how to use machine learning to upscale the results. No previous knowledge of programming is required.
