As a complement to my research activity I'm commited to spread science and make it reachable, available and hopefully usefull through different cultural and social backgrounds.
In order to mitigate the global change we are facing, all the inhabitants of the Earth deserve clear and transparent information as well as the oportunity to
connect to science. Science belong to all of us so is also our responsability to take some time to explain it in plain words.

TEACHING

Teaching assitant at the MIT graduate course "Carbon cycle and Ecosystem Ecology". Spring semester 2022 and 2023.
Lecture about the role of nutrients in the carbon cycle, R programming, and using R to solve ecological problems (AI models, GIS, statistics, data curation...)

VIDEO

No science without diversity (Catalan, Spanish, subtitles in English). Claim for a more diverse science in order to make it representative of all races, genders, 
cultural background and physical capabilities.

WORKSHOPS

[Climate Action Through Education (CATE)](https://ceepr.mit.edu/cate/)
An exciting synery of high school teachers and MIT scientist to implement climate change curricula to Massachusetts high schools. The project's pilot implementation starts the fall of 2022.

[Escolab](https://escolab.bcn.cat/en)<br>
I was approaching environmental sciences and climate change to 12-14 year old students. We performed 4h workshops about how environmental scientists take samples 
in order to answer ecological questions.
