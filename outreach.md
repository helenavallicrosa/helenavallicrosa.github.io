As a complement to my research and teaching activities, I'm committed to spreading science and making it reachable, available, and hopefully useful through different cultural and social backgrounds.
To mitigate the global change we are facing, all the inhabitants of the Earth deserve clear and transparent information as well as the opportunity to connect to science. Science belongs to all of us so is also our responsibility to take some time to explain it in plain words.

[That's what I call science](https://thatsscience.org/2024/05/19/episode-236-elements-of-a-scientist/)<br>
May 2024. Episode 236 of the Tasmanian podcast TWICS. The hot, dry Mediterranean, the depths of the tropics and the computer screen, Dr Helena Vallicrosa works in a range of environments to understand how chemical elements, the building blocks of the earth, cycle through ecosystems. The ‘annoying kid’ who always asked questions, a lack of representation in science meant that Helena didn’t always think a career in science was available to her. Now Helena uses ‘big data’ to find patterns and answer big questions about where plants can live and why in the complex landscape of a changing climate. Listen to hear Helena break-down her research, motivations as a scientist, and a career in science (academia vs industry) into their core elements.

### VIDEO

[Introduction to R and Geographical Information Systyems](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP602LxEgWcCyo89B2Q-zg8gm)<br>
Fall, 2023. MIT openCourseWare course. View the complete course [here](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/introduction-to-r-and-gis-fall-2023/)

The goal of these videos is to provide students with tools and concepts to work with R*. The students will learn the basics of R, how to navigate R interface and deal with different data formats, how to run and interpret linear models with R and how to use Geographical Information Systems (GIS) in R. These practical sessions were developed as part of the course 1.845 Terrestrial Carbon Cycle and Ecosystem Ecology but will be useful for anyone looking to learn about R and GIS.![Captura de pantalla 2024-07-11 a les 11 00 04](https://github.com/helenavallicrosa/helenavallicrosa.github.io/assets/105129252/65f717a5-9755-4beb-8167-b1f9c6b52815)


[Ni hi ha ciència sense diversitat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=8nn4dMdkvhI)<br>
No science without diversity (Catalan, Spanish, subtitles in English). Claim for a more diverse science to make it representative of all races, genders, 
cultural backgrounds, and physical capabilities.
