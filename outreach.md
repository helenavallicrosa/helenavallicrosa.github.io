As a complement to my research and teaching activities, I'm committed to spreading science and making it reachable, available, and hopefully useful through different cultural and social backgrounds.
To mitigate the global change we are facing, all the inhabitants of the Earth deserve clear and transparent information as well as the opportunity to connect to science. Science belongs to all of us so is also our responsibility to take some time to explain it in plain words.

### RADIO/PODCASTS

[That's what I call science](https://thatsscience.org/2024/05/19/episode-236-elements-of-a-scientist/)<br>
Episode 236 of the Tasmanian podcast TWICS. The hot, dry Mediterranean, the depths of the tropics and the computer screen, Dr Helena Vallicrosa works in a range of environments to understand how chemical elements, the building blocks of the earth, cycle through ecosystems. The ‘annoying kid’ who always asked questions, a lack of representation in science meant that Helena didn’t always think a career in science was available to her. Now Helena uses ‘big data’ to find patterns and answer big questions about where plants can live and why in the complex landscape of a changing climate. Listen to hear Helena break-down her research, motivations as a scientist, and a career in science (academia vs industry) into their core elements. May 2024.

### WORKSHOPS

[Climate Action Through Education (CATE)](https://ceepr.mit.edu/cate/)<br>
An exciting synergy of high school teachers and MIT scientists to implement climate change curricula in Massachusetts high schools. The project's pilot implementation starts in the fall of 2022.

[Escolab](https://escolab.bcn.cat/en)<br>
I was approaching environmental sciences and climate change to 12-14-year-old students. We performed 4h workshops about how environmental scientists take samples 
in order to answer ecological questions.
