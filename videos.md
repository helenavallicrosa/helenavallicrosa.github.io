### Presentation: The role of plant–soil–microbe interactions on nitrogen cycling under drought and warming in grasslands

Presentation on the New Phythologist Symposia "Microbes as hidden or prominent players in plant life". Short presentation where I disclose my last experimental results. Check the [Video](https://cassyni.com/events/8NYketQ3JdK2JPuUVndMk1/seminar/abstract)

### Teaching: Introduction to R and Geographic Information Systems (GIS)

The goal of these videos is to provide students with tools and concepts for working with R, a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. The students will learn the basics of R, how to navigate the R interface and deal with different data formats, how to run and interpret linear models with R, and how to use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in R. These practical sessions were developed as part of the course 1.845 Terrestrial Carbon Cycle and Ecosystem Ecology but will be useful for anyone looking to learn about R and GIS.

Materials available on MIT [OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/introduction-to-r-and-gis-fall-2023/) or [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP602LxEgWcCyo89B2Q-zg8gm)

### Seminar: Plant Elemental Ecology: Understanding Plant Nutrient Flows in a Global Change Context

This seminar tackles three main points:

i) Introduction to the concept of elemental ecology, which studies the interactions between organisms (plant-soil-ecosystem) through elemental composition and elements flow. Elemental ecology is a relevant tool to study the impact of changes in chemical cycles (Carbon, Nitrogen, Phosphorus…) associated with global change on ecosystems.

ii) Presentation of the results of a study in preparation: leaf habits and climate drives tree growth sensitivity to N deposition. This study addresses the ReClean goal of better understanding the impacts of N deposition on vegetation at a continental scale.

iii) An experiment set up to better understand the N flow in grasslands, accounting for soil N, the microbial community, belowground biomass, aboveground biomass, and reproductive tissues.
